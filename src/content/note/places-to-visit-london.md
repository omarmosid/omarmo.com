A friend of mine is visiting from Canada and asked me for my recommendations of places to visit.

Here's what I recommended to him:

- Big Ben, London Eye and South Bank Market
- Buckingham Palace and St James Park
- Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Street
- London Bridge, Tower Bridge and Tower of London
- Hyde Park, Monument, Kensington Palace, Natural History Museum
- Regents Park, London Central Mosque, Sherlock Holmes Museum
- Cutty Sark, Royal Observatory in Greenwich
- Whitechapel, East London Mosque
