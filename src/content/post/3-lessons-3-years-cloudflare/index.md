Three years ago, I joined Cloudflare, excited but also… terrified.
I had just stepped into one of the most talented engineering teams I’d ever seen. Everyone seemed smarter, quicker, and more experienced. My inner voice kept saying: Don’t mess up. Don’t ask a stupid question. Just keep your head down and deliver.

I quickly learned that mindset would hold me back — and that the real growth came from leaning into discomfort. Here are the three lessons that changed how I work.

## 1. Ask Questions — Even When It’s Uncomfortable
In my first few months, I was obsessed with “performing.” I wanted to prove I could keep up, so I avoided asking questions that might make me look inexperienced. The result? I’d spend hours figuring something out that I could’ve solved in minutes if I’d just spoken up.

One day, I got stuck on a gnarly bug in our backend validation code. I hesitated for hours before finally asking a senior engineer for help. Instead of judging me, they walked me through the problem — and even complimented how I’d framed my question: I had written down my understanding, my assumptions, what I’d already tried, and my end goal.

That’s when it clicked: asking questions is a skill.
The better you prepare your question, the more respect you earn. My go-to approach became:

* Frame your understanding (“Here’s how I think this works…”)
* Share your assumptions
* Explain what you’ve tried
* State your end goal

Sometimes I’d even write a “brain dump” in a wiki or spec before asking. Not only did it make my questions sharper, it often led me to the answer myself.

## 2. Be Reliable — Even on Your Worst Days
I’ve had days where my motivation was low, my energy was shot, or things outside of work were weighing on me. But early on, I realised something important: your reputation isn’t built on your best days. It’s built on your worst ones.

My manager Ruskin once told me: “You’re as good as your worst day.” It reminded me of James Clear’s line from Atomic Habits:

> You don’t rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.

Reliability is about building systems so you can deliver consistently. For me, that meant:

* Breaking down projects into daily and weekly goals
* Breaking down tasks/tickets into smaller more managable pieces
* Aligning with my manager on what “done” means before starting on any task/project
* Paying attention to details, being my own QA.
* Seeking clarity early so I didn’t waste time later
* Following through, even when I didn’t feel like it

The payoff? People began to trust that if I committed to something, it would get done — no matter what was going on behind the scenes.

## 3. Be Customer-Obsessed — Your Job Doesn’t End at Shipping Code
One of the biggest mindset shifts I had was realising my work wasn’t “done” when the code was merged.

At Cloudflare, some of our most valuable insights came from Solution Engineers (who design solutions for customers) and Account Managers (who maintain relationships and advocate for customer needs). Many times, they’d bring up a bug or feature request that came directly from a frustrated customer.

Early in my career, I might’ve treated that like just another ticket. Now, I see it differently:

That bug could be blocking someone from launching their product.

That feature request could save a team hours of work every week.

I started engaging more — joining Discord conversations, reading through community forum threads, and even following up directly with the SE or AM who reported an issue. Not only did it make the products better, it gave me a real sense of purpose.

## Final Word
These three lessons — asking better questions, being reliable, and obsessing over the customer — aren’t complicated. But practiced over years, they compound into something powerful.

I’d love to hear: what’s one lesson you’ve learned that’s shaped your career?
