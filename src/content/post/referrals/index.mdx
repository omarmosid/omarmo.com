People ask me for referrals all the time. My answer is always the same: I only refer people I know personally.

Here’s why: a referral isn’t just about passing along a name. It only makes sense if I actually know how someone works, how reliable they are, and what kind of value they bring. That’s not something you can see from a LinkedIn profile or a CV — it comes from real interaction.

When I refer someone, I want it to be genuinely useful. If I connect you with a person, it’s because I’ve seen enough to know they’ll add value. Otherwise, the introduction wastes everyone’s time.

I’d rather give fewer referrals that actually help, than throw out names I can’t vouch for. It keeps things authentic and makes sure the people I do refer are taken seriously.

## How to Reach Out to Me If You Want a Referral

If you want me to know you, introduce yourself properly. Tell me who you are, what you do, and why you’re reaching out. Don’t just send me a “hi” and wait — that goes nowhere. (see: [nohello.net](https://nohello.net))

Make it easy for me to understand who you are and why you’re asking. That’s the first step to building the kind of connection where a referral actually makes sense.
