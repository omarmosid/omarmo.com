# Cloudflare Zaraz

Cloudflare Zaraz is a third-party tool manager that revolutionizes how websites handle external scripts by loading them in the cloud instead of the browser, dramatically improving performance, security, and user privacy.

## Overview

Zaraz runs on Cloudflare's global network spanning 330 cities across 125 countries, dynamically deploying third-party tools with minimal latency regardless of user location. By offloading third-party scripts from the browser to Cloudflare Workers, Zaraz eliminates the performance bottlenecks typically associated with external tools.

## Key Features

### üöÄ **Performance Optimization**
- **Cloud-based execution**: Third-party tools run on Cloudflare's edge network, not in the browser
- **Minimal code changes**: Speed improvements without requiring website modifications
- **Reduced browser load**: Eliminates JavaScript execution overhead from external scripts
- **Global edge deployment**: Low latency delivery from 330+ locations worldwide

### üîí **Enhanced Security**
- **Reduced attack surface**: Limits what scripts can execute on your website
- **Third-party risk mitigation**: Protects against potential compromises in external tools
- **Controlled execution environment**: Scripts run in isolated Cloudflare Workers
- **Security monitoring**: Built-in protection against malicious third-party behavior

### üõ°Ô∏è **Privacy & Data Control**
- **Sensitive data protection**: Alerts and masking when sensitive information is passed to vendors
- **Data flow visibility**: Clear oversight of what data reaches third-party services
- **Privacy compliance**: Better control over user data sharing with external tools
- **Granular permissions**: Fine-tuned control over third-party tool capabilities
