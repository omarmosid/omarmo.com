# Managed Components

Managed Components is an open format for defining third-party tool behaviors and capabilities, enabling fast and secure management of tools that run outside the browser.

## Overview

Managed Components revolutionizes how third-party tools are integrated into websites by moving execution away from the browser to servers and edge locations. This approach significantly improves performance, security, and privacy for web applications.

## Key Features

### ðŸš€ **Performant**
- Code execution outside the browser (server-side, edge computing)
- Reduced browser load and faster page rendering
- No need for additional JavaScript execution in the browser
- Eliminates external server connections during page load

### ðŸ”’ **Secure & Private**
- Granular permissions system
- Components can only perform explicitly allowed actions
- No JavaScript execution in browser by default
- Enhanced user privacy protection

### ðŸ†“ **Free & Open Source**
- Runs freely using WebCM (open source Components Manager)
- Growing ecosystem of open-sourced components
- Community-driven development
- Transparent and auditable codebase

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript/TypeScript** - Core development language
- **WebCM** - Open source Components Manager
- **Edge Computing** - Distributed execution environment
- **Server-side Processing** - Backend component execution

## Impact & Benefits

- **Performance**: Significantly reduced browser overhead and faster page loads
- **Security**: Granular permission system prevents unauthorized actions
- **Privacy**: User data protection through controlled component behavior
- **Developer Experience**: Simple integration and management of third-party tools

## Getting Started

The project provides comprehensive documentation and a 5-minute quickstart guide for developers to create their own Managed Components. The ecosystem includes:

- Detailed specifications and documentation
- Component creation tools
- Active community support via Discord
- Extensive GitHub repository with examples

## What I Learned

This project demonstrates the importance of rethinking traditional web architecture patterns. By moving third-party tool execution away from the browser, we can achieve significant improvements in performance, security, and user privacy while maintaining functionality and ease of use.
